# InstantSCCS

`InstantSCCS` is a softcore Community Service script for looping in Kingdom of Loathing designed to work for low-shiny accounts (i.e. accounts with minimal expensive items/skills) and mostly requires only cheap resources. Unfortunately, this means that the user is expected to have a bunch of softcore-permed skills, and at least ~4 IotMs in order to enable this (one of which is the [Clan VIP Lounge key](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_VIP_Lounge_key)).

## Installation

To install the script, use the following command in the KoLMafia CLI.

```text
git checkout https://github.com/Pantocyclus/InstantSCCS.git release
```

## Usage

For those who are interested in using `InstantSCCS` as is, the following sections detail the prerequisites, choices in Valhalla, and required resources.

### Before Ascending

- Ensure that you have the following items (which will be pulled/used during the run): 1x [one-day ticket to Dinseylandfill](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/One-day_ticket_to_Dinseylandfill), 1x [Calzone of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Calzone_of_Legend), 1x [Deep Dish of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Deep_Dish_of_Legend), 1x [Pizza of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Pizza_of_Legend) and 1x [borrowed time](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Borrowed_time).
- Ensure that you have access to a clan with a fully stocked [VIP lounge](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/VIP_Lounge). Also ensure that the [Clan Floundry](<https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_Floundry_(VIP_Lounge)>) has sufficient stocks of cod to pull a [codpiece](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Codpiece).
- Have any one of the [factory-irregular skeleton](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Factory-irregular_skeleton), [remaindered skeleton](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Remaindered_skeleton) or [swarm of skulls](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Swarm_of_skulls) banished in your [ice house](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Ice_house).

### In Valhalla

Because we rely heavily on the cookbookbat ingredients, (1) this route only works for Saucerors, and (2) the astral six-pack is the only useful astral consumable since it doesn't compete with the stomach-space required by the CBB. The pet sweater allows us to benefit from the Disgeist in the NC test, while giving us +5 turngen and free +11ML from the [Mind Control Device](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Mind_control_device).

- [astral six-pack](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Astral_six-pack) from The Deli Lama
- [astral pet sweater](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Astral_pet_sweater) from Pet Heaven
- [Sauceror](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Sauceror)
- [The Opposum](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/The_Opposum)
- [Softcore](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Ascension#Normal_Difficulty)

### Required IotMs

IotMs are incredibly expensive, and they tend to increase in price the longer they have existed due to the artificial supply limit. Unfortunately, they are incredibly powerful too, and so we will need to rely on them to enable a 1-day SCCS. There is a hard requirement on the [Clan VIP Lounge key](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_VIP_Lounge_key), as it is one of the few "IotMs" that are recurring (and thus are not gated by the same artificial supply limit as mentioned above), and it provides access to >= 30 Mr. A's-worth of IotMs. <br />
One of the hardest tasks in CS is levelling, due to the limited resources we have access to to optimise for the stat tests (HP, Mus, Myst, Mox). The other required IotMs thus have to provide incredible statgain and/or turngen potential. The current routing is thus built around the following 3 other IotMs.

| IotM                                                                                      | Use         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [Clan VIP Lounge key](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_VIP_Lounge_key) | many things |
| [model train set](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Model_train_set)         | xp          |
| [cosmic bowling ball](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Cosmic_bowling_ball) | xp + banish |
| [cookbookbat](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Cookbookbat)                 | turngen     |

### Other Useful IotMs

If you're looking to modify the script yourself, you may also consider these useful IotMs. Any IotM that grants access to a scaler zone helps save a pull on the daypass, which may then be used on other useful pulls (e.g. [non-Euclidean angle](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Non-Euclidean_angle)). Special shoutout to the [combat lover's locket](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Combat_lover%27s_locket), which gives access to 3 additional fax targets, of which there are a few useful targets including the [ungulith](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Ungulith), [factory worker(female)](<https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Factory_worker_(female)>), [novelty tropical skeleton](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Novelty_tropical_skeleton), [ice concierge](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Ice_concierge) or [some](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Witchess_Bishop) [useful](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Witchess_King) [witchess](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Witchess_Queen) [pieces](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Witchess_Witch). Once you start getting more and more [free fight sources](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Free_Fights), the less reliant you will be on the trainset and bowling ball for xp (they may be swapped out). Shinies that reduce turncount on the tests will then reduce the reliance on the cookbookbat for turngen.

### Required Resources

Because we do not rely heavily on too many IotMs to carry us through the SCCS run, we will have certain hard requirements on a bunch of skills and familiars that will enable this run. <br />
<sub><sup>Note that the shinier you are, the easier it becomes to replace these requirements, so they would eventually become soft or even non-requirements (especially those extremely small contributors).</sup></sub> <br />

| Familiars                                                                        | Use      |

### Highly-recommended Resources

Chances are, it's going to be super tight if you only have the resources stated above. There are a bunch of potentially cheap-ish (more expensive than 1m, but cheaper than an IotM) things that can greatly aid your runs. Generally, you want to get anything that aids in leveling (gives more myst% and/or free fights) <br />
<sub><sup>Note that free fight sources are super useful - this includes NEP, witchess, backup camera etc.</sup></sub> <br />

| Useful stuff                                                                           | Use   |
