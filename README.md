# InstantSCCS

`InstantSCCS` is a softcore Community Service script for looping in Kingdom of Loathing designed to work for low-shiny accounts (i.e. accounts with minimal expensive items/skills) and mostly requires only cheap resources. Unfortunately, this means that the user is expected to have a bunch of softcore-permed skills, and at least 2 IoTMs in order to enable this (one of which is the [Clan VIP Lounge key](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_VIP_Lounge_key)).

## Installation

To install the script, use the following command in the KoLMafia CLI.

```text
git checkout https://github.com/Pantocyclus/InstantSCCS.git release
```

## Usage

For those who are interested in using `InstantSCCS` as is, the following sections detail the prerequisites, choices in Valhalla, and required resources.

### Before Ascending

- Ensure that you have the following items (which will be pulled/used during the run): 1x [one-day ticket to Dinseylandfill](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/One-day_ticket_to_Dinseylandfill), 1x [Calzone of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Calzone_of_Legend), 1x [Pizza of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Pizza_of_Legend), 1x [Deep Dish of Legend](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Deep_Dish_of_Legend), 1x [roasted vegetable focaccia](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Roasted_vegetable_focaccia) and 10x [cranberries](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Cranberries).
- Ensure that you have access to a clan with a fully stocked [VIP lounge](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/VIP_Lounge). Also ensure that the [Clan Floundry](<https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_Floundry_(VIP_Lounge)>) has sufficient stocks of cod to pull a [codpiece](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Codpiece).

### In Valhalla

- [astral six-pack](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Astral_six-pack) from The Deli Lama
- [astral pet sweater](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Astral_pet_sweater) from Pet Heaven
- [Pastamancer](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Pastamancer)
- [The Opposum](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/The_Opossum)
- [Softcore](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Ascension#Normal_Difficulty)

### IoTMs

IoTMs are incredibly expensive, and they tend to increase in price the longer they have existed due to the artificial supply limit. Unfortunately, they are incredibly powerful too, and so we will need to rely on them to enable a 1-day SCCS. There is a hard requirement on the [Clan VIP Lounge key](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Clan_VIP_Lounge_key), as it is one of the few "IoTMs" that are recurring (and thus are not gated by the same artificial supply limit as mentioned above), and it provides access to >= 30 Mr. A's-worth of IoTMs. <br />
One of the hardest tasks in CS is levelling, due to the limit resources we have access to and the fact that we aim to cap out all of the stat tests (HP, Mus, Myst, Mox). The 2nd IoTM thus has to provide incredible statgain potential. This either comes in the form of providing a scaling zone (with which we can then save a pull on the Dinsey daypass to pull a [non-Euclidean angle](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Non-Euclidean_angle) instead), or provide stats directly. It is thus a hard-requirement to have at least one of these few IoTMs.

### Required Resources

Because we do not rely heavily on IoTMs to carry us through the SCCS run, we will have certain hard requirements on a bunch of skills and familiars that will enable this run. <br />
<sub><sup>Note that the shinier you are, the easier it becomes to replace these requirements, so they would eventually become soft or even non-requirements.</sup></sub> <br />

| Familiars                                                                             | Use            |

### Highly-recommended Resources

Chances are, it's going to be super tight if you only have the resources stated above. There are a bunch of potentially cheap-ish (more expensive than 1m, but cheaper than an IoTM) things that can greatly aid your runs. Generally, you want to get anything that aids in leveling (gives more myst% and/or free fights) <br />
<sub><sup>Note that free fight sources are super useful - this includes NEP, witchess, backup camera etc.</sup></sub> <br />

| Useful stuff                                                                           | Use   |
